# BRC Bi Spot
JumboCode 2018-2019 project for Bisexual Resource Center, led by Steph Xu.


## Project Description
Bisexual Resource Center is an educational organization headquartered in Boston, MA, and has information on bi-related organizations around the nation and relevant events. The objectives of this project is to further the support for the bisexual community with available resources from BRC and similar organizations, enhance "bi+" visiblity by helping people discover social activities around us, and raise public awareness about non-monosexual identities. 

To visitors of the website, we provide a web application that displays a comprehensive map view of Bi+ organizations and events based on geographical locations, along with basic contact/sign-up guides. The app will enhance the experience of exploring local groups and events for anyone in need. An interactive search tool connected to the map view will provide easy access of the information.
